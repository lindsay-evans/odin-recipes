    <h2>This cake is great served as it is. The crumble and the rich cake batter are perfectly satisfying without embellishments, but a dollop of barely sweetened whipped cream is always welcome!</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <p>For the streusel topping</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup (180g) brown sugar, packed</li>
        <li>1 cup (125g) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (113g) unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>Pinch of kosher salt</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For the cinnamon layer</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup (50g) sugar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For the cake batter</p>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups (375g) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 1/4 cups (450g) sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 cup (226g) unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup (230g) sour cream</li>
        <li>1/4 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Farenheit and spray a 9x13" pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the streusel layer:</strong> In a small bowl, combine the flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Use a fork to mash the butter into the mixture until completely combined and crumbly. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the cinnamon layer:</strong> In another small bowl, combine the sugar, flour, and cinnamon. Set aside as well.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the batter:</strong> in the bowl of your mixer, add the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and kosher salt. Using the paddle attachment, stir on low to combine.</li>
        <li>Add the softened butter and beat on medium-low speed for 2 to 3 minutes, or until all of the butter is mixed in, and the mixture resembles moist sand.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the sour cream, milk, eggs, and vanilla until combined. Add the mixture to the dry ingredients. Beat the batter on medium speed until you get a smooth batter. A few small lumps are totally fine.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the cake:</strong> Spread half the batter into the prepared pan. Sprinkle the cinnamon sugar layer over the top half of the batter in an even layer. Spread the remaining batter over the top (this does require some patience since the batter likes to lift off the cinnamon sugar layer). Top with the crumble mixture.</li>
        <li>Bake for 55 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool on a rack for 1 hour (or until cake comes to room temperature) before serving.</li>
        <li>You can make this cake a day or two in advance. Remove the cake from the pan and cover with plastic wrap. Keep it on the counter at room temperature. To free the cake, wrap it in plastic, followed by foil.</li>
    </ol>
